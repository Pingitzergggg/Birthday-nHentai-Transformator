<h1>Birthday to nHentai translator</h1> 
<h2>Made by P_Gggg</h2>
<h2>This basically transforms your birthday into an nHentai code and opens the link to it.</h2>
<ul>
<li>for example: </li>
<li>year: 2003 </li>
<li>month: February </li>
<li>day: 12 </li>
<li>Your code is: 030212 </li>
</ul>
<h2>The day and the month is pretty obvious, but the year can be transformed in two ways: </h2>
<h3>If the year is 2000 or more: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Then it will transform the last two digits of the year </li>
<li>for example: 2003 -> 03 </li>
</ul>
<h3>If the year is less then 2000: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Then it will use the first number which is always a "1" in this case and the last number of the year </li>
<li>for example: 1968 -> 18 </li>
<li>This is needed because with the normal transformation used on the 2000's the first number would simply be too big and there is not enough >hentai for it  </li>
</ul>
<h1>I don't know who is crazy enough to use this, but have fun I guess</h1>
